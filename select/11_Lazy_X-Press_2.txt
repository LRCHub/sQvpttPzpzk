I-I-I-I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Ooooh, don't you wanna save me

I'm lazy when I'm lovin', I'm lazy when I play
I'm lazy with my girlfriend a thousand times a day
I'm lazy when I'm speaking, I'm lazy when I walk
I'm lazy when I'm dancin' and I'm lazy when I talk
I open up my mouth, it comes rushin' out
Nothin', doin' nada, never, how you like me now?
Wouldn't it be mad, wouldn't it be fine
Lazy, lucky lady, dancin', lovin' all the time

I-I-I-I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Ooooh, don't you wanna save me

Some folks they got money and some folks lives are sweet
Some folks make decisions and some folks clean the streets, now
Imagine what it feels like, imagine how it sounds
Imagine life is perfect and everything works out
No tears are fallin' from my eyes I'm keepin' all the pain inside
Now don't you wanna live with me? I'm lazy as a man can be!

I-I-I-I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Ooooh, don't you wanna save me

Imagine there's a girlfriend, imagine there's a job
Imagine there's an answer, imagine there's a God
Imagine I'm a Devil, imagine I'm a Saint
Lazy money, lazy sexy, lazy outta space!

No tears are fallin' from my eyes
I'm keepin' all the pain inside
Now don't you wanna live with me?
I'm lazy as a man can be!

I-I-I-I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Ooooh, don't you wanna save me

Lazy when I work, lazy on the bed
Screamin' all you like, but it only fades away
I'm lazy when I'm prayin', lazy on the job
Got a lazy mind, a lazy eye, a lazy lazy father

Hard men, hard lives
Hard keepin' it all inside
Good times, good God
I'm so lazy I almost stop!
*Cough*

I-I-I-I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Ooooh, don't you wanna save me
I-I-I-I'm wicked and I'm lazy
Ooooh, don't you wanna save me
