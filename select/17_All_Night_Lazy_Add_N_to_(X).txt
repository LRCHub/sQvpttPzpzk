When we're roamin' the streets and we see one car
We always add one and make it two
It don't matter why we like to add one and one
Out here it's the thing to do
Now some say that screaming one plus one all night
Means we're thoughtless, cruel, and bad
But kids like you and me baby, we were born to add
Yes, sir, we were!
As we keep on wandering we see two trash cans
So we add one and make it three
There's alot of us adders on the Jersey Shore
Out here it's the thing to be
Yeah, we'll keep on shoutin' one plus two
Even though it makes 'em mad
[Cause kids like you and me baby, we were born to addBaby we were born to add! One and two and three police persons spring out of the shadowsDown the corner comes one moreAnd we scream into that city night, three plus one makes four! Well, they seemed to think we're disturbin' the peaceBut we won't let 'em make us sad]cause kids like you and me baby, we were born to add
Baby we were born to add!
Baby we were born to add!
Add! Add! Add!
Baby we were born to add!
Add! Add! Add!
Baby we were born to add!
Oh, Add
Baby we were born to add!
Baby we were born to add!
Add, add, add, add, add!
