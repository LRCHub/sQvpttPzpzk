I made a will,
Mother make it slow.
I picture at you sometimes,
And Imagine you Alone.

An Arcade Wheel,
Another for the view.
Fingers of steel,
Straight in like the chill.

Yeah, I made a will,
Mother make it slow.
I picture at you sometimes,
And Imagine you Alone.

I've got a twitch,
Oh mother make it slow.
I picture at you sometimes,
And Imagine you Alone.
